# Noto fonts

Noto’s goal is to provide a beautiful reading experience for all languages. In visual harmony when multiple languages share a page. With multiple styles and weights. Noto covers all major languages of the world, plus many minority and historical languages. All fonts are published under the [SIL OFL-1.1 license](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).
